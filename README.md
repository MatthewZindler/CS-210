# CS-210
SNHU CS-210 repository

This project was for module five, regarding a banking application to display investment amounts and returns for given user inputs.
I felt I did this project well overall, the user interface particularly well. There is of course room for improvement, but from my current understanding I was able to fully implement every required function to the best of my ability while also making it user friendly. I was able to implement a few methods to minimize the main body of code to just user interface.
There is still room for improvement in my code for sure. I don't know 100%, but I believe I could simplify my code and maybe even shift my UI to a method to make the main while body of code much shorter than it currently is. This would increase readibility and OOP, and would be good practice for future programming.
